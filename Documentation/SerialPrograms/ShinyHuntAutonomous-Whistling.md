# Shiny Hunt Autonomous - In-place Whistling

This program will stand in one place and whistle. It will run from all non-shiny encounters and stop on the first shiny it finds.

- No calibration is needed. This program will detect a shiny from its animation.
- When a shiny is encountered, this program will save a video of the encounter.
- This program will keep track of encounter statistics.

This program is indended for any flying Pokémon that respawn or overworld Pokémon that will consistently charge at you. 
For regular overworld Pokémon, use the [overworld bot](ShinyHuntAutonomous-Overworld.md) instead.

## Instructions:
- Screen size must be 100%.
- Video resolution is 1280 x 720 or higher. Shiny detection is not reliable at low resolutions.
- If playing in an Asian language, your video resolution should be 1920 x 1080. Text recognition is more accurate at higher resolutions.
- You must have system time unsynced.
- Casual mode is off.
- Your text speed must be set to fast.
- You must be standing in a place where you will constantly be attacked by whistling.
- Your lead Pokémon must be able to run away. (faster or holding Smoke Ball)
- Your lead Pokémon must not be shiny. (this will cause false positive detections)
- You must be in the overworld. (not inside the menu)
- You must be zoomed out to maximize the view.
- Start the program in the [Change Grip/Order Menu](../Appendix/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md).

**Recommended for Performance:**
- Have the Shiny Charm. This triples the chance to find a shiny.
- Your lead Pokémon does not have high happiness.
- Your lead Pokémon does not have an ability that activates upon entry to battle.

When a shiny is found, the program will save a video of the encounter.

## Options:

This program uses [`TOLERATE_SYSTEM_UPDATE_MENU_FAST`](../Appendix/GlobalSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-fast) to bypass the system update window.

There is no option to search only for a square shiny. Nearly all shinies are square and only 15/65536 are star. Therefore it is infeasible to hunt for star shiny.


### Go Home when Done:

After finding a shiny, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.


### Game Language:

If set to a language, the program will attempt to read the name of each Pokémon you encounter and log it.

If you are playing in an Asian language (Japanese, Korean, Chinese), set your video resolution to 1080p or higher. These languages are difficult to accurately read with text recognition at low resolutions.


### Time Rollback:

Every this many hours, rollback the time by this many hours. This keeps the time constant to prevent the weather from changing. It also allows you to target time-specific marks. Set this to zero to disable this feature.


## Advanced Settings:
These are advanced settings. You shouldn’t need to touch these unless something isn’t working and you’re trying to debug it yourself.


### Exit Battle Timeout:

After running, wait this long to return to the overworld. The program will resume before this time if it detects that that the battle has ended.
